# SR-2660

This is the sample project created by Todd Fiala in
https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-2660, updated to work with modern Swift 4.

To use this yourself, modify `build.sh` such that `SWIFTC`, `SWIFT_SDK`,
`SWIFT_LIB`, `CLANG`, `LLDB` point to approproate locations on your host
machine, then run `build.sh`.
